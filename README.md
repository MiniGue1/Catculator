What it does
- Presents a realistic-looking calculator UI using Tkinter (desktop) and a simple web version using Flask.

How to run (desktop)
- Run `python calculator.py` in this folder.

How to run (web)
- Install Flask: `pip install flask`
- Run `python app.py` from the repository root and open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser.
